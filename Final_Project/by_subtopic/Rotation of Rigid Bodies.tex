\subsection{Rotation of Rigid Bodies}
\begin{itemize}
\item (2018)  Why is flywheel designed such that most of its mass is concentrated at the rim? Briefly explain. 
\item (2018)  Estimate the couple that will bring the wheel to rest in $ 10$ seconds when a grinding wheel of radius $ 40$ cm and mass $ 3$ kg is rotating at $ 3600$ revolutions per minute. 
\item (2018)  Why an ice skater rotates at relatively low speed when stretches her arms and a leg outward? 
\item (2018)  Calculate the moment of inertia of a sphere about an axis which is a tangent to its surface given that the mass and radius of the sphere are $ 10$ kg and $ 0.2$ m respectively. 
\end{itemize}
