\subsection{Projectile Motion}
\begin{itemize}
\item (2019)  Justify the statement that projectile motion is two dimensional motion.
\item (2019)  A rocket was launched with a velocity of $ 50$ m$/$s from the surface of the moon at an angle of $ 40^{\circ}$ to the horizontal, Calculate the horizontal distance covered  after half time of flight.
\item (2019)  Show that the angle of projection $ \theta ^{\circ}$ for a projectile launched from the origin is given by $ \theta ^{\circ}= tan^{-1}(4h_{m}/R)$ , where $ R$ stand for horizontal range and $ h_{m}$ is the maximum vertical height.
\item (2019)  Determine the angle of projection for which the horizontal range of a projectile is $ 4\sqrt{3}$ times its maximum height. 
\end{itemize}
