\begin{itemize}
\item (1998)  What is terminal velocity?
\item (1998)  Briefly explain an experiment designed to measure terminal velocity.
\item (1998)  A small sphere of radius $ r$ and density $ \sigma $ is released from the bottom of a column of liquid of density $ \rho $ which is slightly higher than $ \sigma $ . Deduce expressions for;
 \begin{itemize}
\item the initial acceleration of the sphere.
\item the terminal velocity of the sphere.
\end{itemize}
\item (1998)  Explain why a length of horse pipe which is lying in a curve on a smooth horizontal surface, straightens out when a fast flowing stream of water passes through it.
\item (1999)  Write down the equation of continuity of a fluid defining all your symbols.
\item (2000)  At two points on a horizontal tube of varying circular cross-section carrying water, the radii are 1cm and $ 0.4$ cm and the pressure difference between these points is $ 4.9$ cm of water. How much liquid flows through the tube per second?
\item (2007)  Write the Continuity and Bernoullisâ€™ equations as applied to fluid dynamics. 
\item (2007)  Develop an equation to determine the velocity of a fluid in a venture meter pipe.
 \begin{itemize}
\item What amount of fluid passes through a section at any given time? 
\end{itemize}
\item (2013)  What is meant by Newtonian fluid? 
\item (2015)  Name the principle on which the continuity equation is based.
\item (2015)  Air is moving fast horizontally past an air-plane.  The speed over the top surface is $ 60$ m$/$s and under the bottom surface is $ 45$ m$/$s.  Calculate the difference in pressure.
\item (2016)   A jet of of water from a fire hose is capable of reaching a height of $ 20$ m.  If the cross sectional area of the hose outlet is $ 4.0	\times 10^{-4}$ m$ ^{2}$ , calculate the:
 \begin{itemize}
\item Minimum speed of water from the hose.
\item Mass of water leaving the hose each second.
\item Force on the hose due to the water jet.
\end{itemize}
\item (2017)  What is the terminal velocity?
\item (2018)  Compute the mass of water striking the wall per second when a jet of water with a velocity of $ 5$ m$/$s and cross-sectional area of $ 3 \times 10^{-2}$ m$ ^{2}$ strikes the wall at right angle losing its velocity to zero. 
\item (2018)  Define the following terms when applied to fluid flow:
 \begin{itemize}
\item Non-viscous fluid 
\item Steady flow 
\item Line of flow 
\item Turbulent flow
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
