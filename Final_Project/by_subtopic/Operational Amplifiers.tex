\begin{itemize}
\item (1998)  Sketch the traces seen on the screen of a cathode ray oscilloscope when two sinusoidal potential differences of the same frequency â€” and amplitude are applied simultaneously to $ X$ and $ Y$ plates of  a cathode ray oscilloscope, when the phase difference between them is:
 \begin{itemize}
\item $ 0^{\circ}$ $ 45^{\circ}$ $ 90^{\circ}$ .
\end{itemize}
\item (1999)  Briefly describe the major factors that you would consider when designing a voltage amplifier.
\item (1999)  With the help of clear diagrams, explain how you would overcome thermal run away in a voltage amplifier.
\item (2000)  Mention any three uses of a CRO.
\item (2000)  What is an operational amplifier 
\item (2000)  List three desirable features of an operational amplifier.
\item (2000)  In almost all cases, where an operation amplifier is used as a linear voltage amplifier, negative feedback is employed. State the advantage of negative feedback.

\item (2009)  An operational amplifier is to have a voltage gain of $ 100$ .  Calculate the required values for the external resistances $ R_{1}$ and $ R_{2}$ when the following gains are required:
 \begin{itemize}
\item non-inverting.
\item Inverting.
