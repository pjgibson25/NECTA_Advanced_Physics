\subsection{Capacitance}
\begin{itemize}
\item (2019)  A parallel plate capacitor with air as a dielectric has plates of area $ 4.0 \times 10^{-2}$ m$ ^{2}$ which are $ 2.0$ mm apart. The capacitor is charged to $ 100$ V battery and connected in parallel with a similar unchanged capacitor with plates of half the area and twice the distance apart. If the edge effect is neglected, calculate the final charge on each plate. 
\item (2019)  Derive an expression for the total capacitance of two capacitors $ C_{1}$ and $ C_{2}$ connected in series. 
\item (2019)  Two capacitor of $ 15$ $\mu$F and $ 20$ $\mu$F are connected in series with a $ 600$ V supply.  Calculate the charge and Potential difference across each capacitor. 
\end{itemize}
