\maketitle

\begin{itemize}
\item (2013)  What is band theory?
\item (2013)  How does the band theory explain electrical properties of solids?
\item (2013)  In an intrinsic semiconductor, the energy gap $ E_{g}=1.2$ eV, and its hole mobility is very much smaller than electron mobility which is Independent of temperature. Assuming that the temperature dependence of intrinsic carrier concentration, $ n_{i}$ is expressed as:
 \begin{itemize}
\item $ N_{i}=n_{o}$ exp$ (-E_{g}/(K_{B}T))$ , where $ n_{o}$ and $ K_{B}$ are constants, $ T$ is temperature and $ E_{g}$ is an energy equal to $ E_{q}/2$ .  
\item What is the ratio between conductivity at $ 600$ K and that at $ 300$ K?
\item Comment on the result obtained above.
\end{itemize}
\item (2017)  How does the forbidden energy gap of an intrinsic semiconductor vary with increase in temperature? 
\end{itemize}
