\subsection{Simple Harmonic Motion}
\begin{itemize}
\item (2019)  Provide two typical examples of simple harmonic motion (S.H.M). 
\item (2019)  Why the velocity and acceleration of a body executing simple harmonic motion are out of phase? 
\item (2019)  The period of a particle executing simple harmonic motion (S.H.M) is $ 3$ seconds. If its amplitude is $ 25$ cm, calculate the time taken by the particle to move a distance of $ 12.5$ cm on either side from the mean position.
\item (2019)  A person weighing $ 50$ kg stands on a platform which oscillates with a frequency of $ 2$ Hz and of amplitude $ 0.05$ m. Find his/her minimum weight as recorded by a machine of the platform.
