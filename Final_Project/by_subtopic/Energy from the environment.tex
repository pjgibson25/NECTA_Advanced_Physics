\maketitle

\begin{itemize}
\item (2016)  Briefly explain three major concepts on solar wind.
\item (2017)  State three sources of heat energy within the interior of the earth. 
\item (2018)  What is meant by solar constant? 
\item (2018)  List two factors on which the solar constant depends. 
\item (2018)  Give two advantages of photovoltaic system. 
\item (2018)  Briefly explain how photovoltaic cells work. 
\item (2018)  Estimate the maximum power available from $ 10$ m$ ^{2}$ of solar panels.  Calculate the volume of water per second which must pass through if the inlet and outlet temperature of the panels are at $ 10^{\circ}$C and $ 60^{\circ}$C respectively. (Assume the wave carries away energy at the same rate as the maximum power available)
