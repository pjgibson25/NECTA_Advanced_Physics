\begin{itemize}
\item (2019)  A rocket of mass $ 20$ kg has $ 180$ kg of fuel. If the exhaust velocity of the fuel is $ 1.6$ km/sec, calculate;
 \begin{itemize}
\item The minimum rate of fuel consumption that enable the rocket to rise from the ground. 
\item The ultimate vertical speed gained by the rocket when the rate of fuel consumption ts $ 2$ kg/sec. 
\end{itemize}
\item (2019)  Determine the least number of pieces required to stop the bullet if a rifle bullet loses $ 1/20$ of its velocity when passing through them.
\item (2019)  A man of $ 100$ kg jumps into a swimming pool from a height of $ 5$ m. If it takes $ 0.4$ seconds for the water in a pool to reduce its velocity to zero, what average force did  the water exert on the man? 
\end{itemize}
