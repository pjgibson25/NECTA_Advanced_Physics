\section{Vibrations and Waves}

\subsection{Sound}
\begin{itemize}
\item (2019)  Provide one evidence which proves that sound is a wave.
\item (2019)  Why thunder of lightning is heard some moments after seeing the flash?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Doppler Effect}
\begin{itemize}
\item (2019)  What is Doppler effect? 
\item (2019)  The cyclist moving at $ 10$ m$/$s and the railway train at $ 20$ m$/$s are approaching each other. If the engine driver sounds a warming siren at a frequency of $ 480$ Hz:
 \begin{itemize}
\item calculate the frequency of the note heard by the cyclist before and after the train has passed away. 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Physical Optics (interferance/diffraction/polarization)}
\begin{itemize}
\item (2019)  Two sheets of a Polaroid are lined up so that their polarization directions are initially parallel. When one sheet is rotated:
 \begin{itemize}
\item How does the transmitted light intensity vary with the angle between the polarization directions of the polaroid? 
\item What angle must the polaroid be rotated to reduce the light Intensity by $ 50\%$ ?
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Wave Motion}
\begin{itemize}
\item (2019)  Give the meaning of the terms wave function, longitudinal wave and transverse waves.
\item (2019)  The equation of a Progressive wave traveling in the $ +x$ direction is given by $ y= a \sin(\omega t-kx)$ .  Show that the maximum velocity, $ V_{max}=2\pi a /T$ . 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Physical Optics (interferance/diffraction/polarization)}
\begin{itemize}
\item (2019)  What is meant by diffraction grating?
\item (2019)  A diffraction grating has $ 500$ lines per millimetre when used with monochromatic light of wavelength $ 6 \times 10^{-7}$ m at normal incidence. Determine the angle at which the bright diffraction images will be observed. 
 \begin{itemize}
\item Why other orders of image above can not be observed? 
\end{itemize}
\item (2019)  State Huygens’s principle of wave construction.
\item (2019)  A lens was placed with a convex surface of radius of curvature $ 50.0$ cm in contact with the plane surface such that Newton’s rings were observed when the lens was illuminated with monochromatic light. If the radius of the $ 15$ th ring was $ 2.13$ mm determine the wavelength. 
\end{itemize}
