\section{Atomic Physics}

\subsection{Structure of the Atom}
\begin{itemize}
\item (2019)  Based on Balmer series of hydrogen spectra determine the wavelength of the series limit of Paschen series. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Quantum Physics}
\begin{itemize}
\item (2019)  Why electrons do not fall into the nucleus due to electrostatic force of attraction?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Structure of the Atom}
\begin{itemize}
\item (2019)  Why hydrogen atom is stable in the ground state? 
\item (2019)  According to Bohrâ€™s theory, the angular momentum of an electron is an integral multiple of $ h/2\pi$ .  Express this statement. by using a mathematical equation in which angular momentum is represented by the letter Land orbit by the letter $ n$ , 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Quantum Physics}
\begin{itemize}
\item (2019)  Determine the angular momentum of the electron in the orbit of energy level $ -3.4$ eV given that $ E_{n}=-13.6/n^{2}$ eV, where $ E$ is the energy of an electron and $ n$ is the principal quantum number of hydrogen atom. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Nuclear Physics}
\begin{itemize}
\item (2019)  What is meant by the following terms as used in nuclear Physics?
 \begin{itemize}
\item Mass defect 
\item Binding energy. 
\end{itemize}
\item (2019)  Elaborate two aspects on which fission reactions differs from fusion reactions.
\item (2019)  Why is high temperature required to cause nuclear fusion? 
\end{itemize}
