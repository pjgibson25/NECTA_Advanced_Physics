\section{Fluid Dynamics}

\subsection{Viscosity and Turbulent Flow}
\begin{itemize}
\item (2019)  Give the meaning of the terms velocity gradient, tangential stress and coefficient of viscosity as used in fluid dynamics.
\item (2019)  Write Stokesâ€™ equation defining clearly the meaning of all symbols used.
 \begin{itemize}
\item State two assumptions used to develop the equation above
\end{itemize}
\item (2019)  Calculate the terminal velocity of the rain drops falling in air assuming that the flow is laminar, the rain drops are spheres of diameter $ 1$ mm and the coefficient of viscosity, $ \eta =1.8 \times 10^{-5}$ Ns$/$m$ ^{2}$ . 
\item (2019)  Water flows past a horizontal plate of area $ 1.2$ m$ ^{2}$ . If its velocity gradient and coefficient of viscosity adjacent to the plate are $ 10$ s$ ^{-1}$ and $ 1.3 \times 10^{-5}$ Ns$/$m$ ^{2}$ respectively, calculate the force acting on the plate.  
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Bernoulli's Principle}
\begin{itemize}
\item (2019)  A horizontal pipe of cross - sectional area $ 10 $ cm$ ^{2}$ has one section of cross sectional area $ 5 $ cm$ ^{2}$ . If water flows through the pipe, and the pressure difference between the two sections is $ 300$ Pa, how many cubic meters of water will flow out of the pipe in $ 1$ minute?
\end{itemize}
