\section{Heat}

\subsection{First Law of Thermodynamics}
\begin{itemize}
\item (2019)  Why water is preferred as a cooling agent in many automobiles?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Thermometers}
\begin{itemize}
\item (2019)  A thermometer has wrong calibration as it reads the melting point of ice as $ -10^{\circ}$C . If it reads $ 40^{\circ}$C in a place where the temperature reads $ 30^{\circ}$C ,  determine the boiling point of water on this scale.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{First Law of Thermodynamics}
\begin{itemize}
\item (2019)  Analyze  three practical applications of thermal expansion of solids in daily life situations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Thermal Conduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item (2019)  A closed metal vessel containing water at $ 75^{\circ}$C , has a surface area of $ 0.5$ m$ ^{2}$ and uniform thickness of $ 4.0$ mm.  If its outside temperature is $ 15^{\circ}$C , calculate the head loss per minute by conduction.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Thermal Radiation}
\begin{itemize}
\item (2019)  Sketch the graph to illustrates how the energy radiated by a black body is distributed among various wavelengths. 
 \begin{itemize}
\item What information would be drawn from the graph above? Give three points.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{First Law of Thermodynamics}
\begin{itemize}
\item (2019)  Why stainless steel cooking pans are made with extra copper at the bottom?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Thermal Radiation}
\begin{itemize}
\item (2019)  At what temperature will the filament of a $ 10$ W lamp operate if it is supposed to be a perfectly black body of area  $ 1 $ cm$ ^{2}$ ? 
\end{itemize}
