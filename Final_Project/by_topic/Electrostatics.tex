\section{Electrostatics}

\subsection{Electric Potential}
\begin{itemize}
\item (2019)  Define the terms electric potential and electric field-strength $ E$ at a point in the electrostatic field.
 \begin{itemize}
\item How the two quantities above related? 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Capacitance}
\begin{itemize}
\item (2019)  Outside the sphere, a charged sphere behaves like its charges were concentrated at the centre. If the electric field strength inside the sphere is zero and one sphere of radius $ 5.0$ cm carries a positive charge of $ 6.7$ nC, calculate; 
 \begin{itemize}
\item the potential at the surface of the sphere. 
\item the capacitance of the sphere. 
\end{itemize}
\item (2019)  What is meant by dielectric constant? 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Electric Field}
\begin{itemize}
\item (2019)  State Coulomb’s law of force between two electrically charged bodies. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Electric Potential}
\begin{itemize}
\item (2019)  Can there be a potential difference between two adjacent conductors carrying the same positive charge? Give a reason. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Capacitance}
\begin{itemize}
\item (2019)  A parallel plate capacitor with air as a dielectric has plates of area $ 4.0 \times 10^{-2}$ m$ ^{2}$ which are $ 2.0$ mm apart. The capacitor is charged to $ 100$ V battery and connected in parallel with a similar unchanged capacitor with plates of half the area and twice the distance apart. If the edge effect is neglected, calculate the final charge on each plate. 
\item (2019)  Derive an expression for the total capacitance of two capacitors $ C_{1}$ and $ C_{2}$ connected in series. 
\item (2019)  Two capacitor of $ 15$ $\mu$F and $ 20$ $\mu$F are connected in series with a $ 600$ V supply.  Calculate the charge and Potential difference across each capacitor. 
\end{itemize}
