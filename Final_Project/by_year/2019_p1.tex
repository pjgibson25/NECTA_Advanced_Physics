\begin{itemize}
\item Identify two basic rules of dimensional analysis.
\item The frequency $ n$ of vibration of a stretched string is a function of its tension $ F$ , the length, $ l$ and mass per unit length $ m$ . Use the method of dimensions to derive the formula relating the stated physical quantities.
\item What causes systematic errors in an experiment? Give four points. 
\item Estimate the numerical value of drag force $ D= 1/2 C \rho  A V^{2}$ with its associated error given that the measurements of the quantities $ C$ , $ A$ , $ \rho $ and $ v$ were recorded as $ (10\pm 0.00)$ unit less $ (5\pm 0.2) $ cm$ ^{2}$ , $ (15\pm 0.15)$ g$/$cm$ ^{3}$ and $ (3\pm 0.5)$ cm$/$sec$ ^{2}$ respectively. 
\item A rocket of mass $ 20$ kg has $ 180$ kg of fuel. If the exhaust velocity of the fuel is $ 1.6$ km/sec, calculate;
 \begin{itemize}
\item The minimum rate of fuel consumption that enable the rocket to rise from the ground. 
\item The ultimate vertical speed gained by the rocket when the rate of fuel consumption ts $ 2$ kg/sec. 
\end{itemize}
\item Determine the least number of pieces required to stop the bullet if a rifle bullet loses $ 1/20$ of its velocity when passing through them.
\item A man of $ 100$ kg jumps into a swimming pool from a height of $ 5$ m. If it takes $ 0.4$ seconds for the water in a pool to reduce its velocity to zero, what average force did  the water exert on the man? 
\item Justify the statement that projectile motion is two dimensional motion.
\item A rocket was launched with a velocity of $ 50$ m$/$s from the surface of the moon at an angle of $ 40^{\circ}$ to the horizontal, Calculate the horizontal distance covered  after half time of flight.
\item Show that the angle of projection $ \theta ^{\circ}$ for a projectile launched from the origin is given by $ \theta ^{\circ}= tan^{-1}(4h_{m}/R)$ , where $ R$ stand for horizontal range and $ h_{m}$ is the maximum vertical height.
\item Determine the angle of projection for which the horizontal range of a projectile is $ 4\sqrt{3}$ times its maximum height. 
\item Provide two typical examples of simple harmonic motion (S.H.M). 
\item Why the velocity and acceleration of a body executing simple harmonic motion are out of phase? 
\item The period of a particle executing simple harmonic motion (S.H.M) is $ 3$ seconds. If its amplitude is $ 25$ cm, calculate the time taken by the particle to move a distance of $ 12.5$ cm on either side from the mean position.
\item A person weighing $ 50$ kg stands on a platform which oscillates with a frequency of $ 2$ Hz and of amplitude $ 0.05$ m. Find his/her minimum weight as recorded by a machine of the platform. 
\item In which aspect does circular motion differ from linear motion? 
\item Why there must be a force acting on a particle moving with uniform speed in a circular path? 
\item A stone tied to the end of string $ 80$ cm long, is whirled in a horizontal circle with a constant speed making $ 25$ revolutions in $ 14$ seconds. Determine the magnitude of its acceleration. 
\item Why the weight of a body becomes zero at the centre of the earth? 
\item How far above the earth surface does the value of acceleration due to gravity becomes $ 36\%$ of its value on the surface? 
\item Compute the period of revolution of a satellite revolving in a circular orbit at a height of $ 3400$ km above the Earthâ€™s surface.

\end{itemize}
\item Why water is preferred as a cooling agent in many automobiles?
\item A thermometer has wrong calibration as it reads the melting point of ice as $ -10^{\circ}$C . If it reads $ 40^{\circ}$C in a place where the temperature reads $ 30^{\circ}$C ,  determine the boiling point of water on this scale.
\item Analyze  three practical applications of thermal expansion of solids in daily life situations.
\item A closed metal vessel containing water at $ 75^{\circ}$C , has a surface area of $ 0.5$ m$ ^{2}$ and uniform thickness of $ 4.0$ mm.  If its outside temperature is $ 15^{\circ}$C , calculate the head loss per minute by conduction.
