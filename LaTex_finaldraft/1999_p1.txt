Mention two applications and two limitations of dimensional analysis.

The frequency $ f$ of a note produced by a taut wire stretched between two supports depends on the distance ​ $ l$ ​ between the supports, the mass per unit length of the wire,$ \mu $ , and the tension $ T$ . Use dimensional analysis to find how $ f$ is related to ​ $ l$ ​ , mu, and $ T$ .
